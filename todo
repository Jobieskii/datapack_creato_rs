to think about: 
    Shouldn't windows be read in / saved one at a time like a text editor? (with open tabs) [UX]
    Should windows_type be more than an enum [Code]
        ( different window may want a different visualizer, 
         or maybe even editor (text instead of graph for commands) – this can also help with node picker )
