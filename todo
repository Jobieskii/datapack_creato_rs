to think about: 
    ~~Shouldn't windows be read in / saved one at a time like a text editor? (with open tabs) [UX]~~
        – No, one datapack is one whole project. This is important when thinking about 
        visualisations – references must be followed which would require loading them in.

    Should windows_type be more than an enum [Code]
        ( different window may want a different visualizer, 
         or maybe even editor (text instead of graph for commands) – this can also help with node picker )
